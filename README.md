# Simulations-of-Wingsuit-Flying
## Abstract

In this project, the Simulation of Wingsuit is investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics. We know that design of wingsuit is of major interest as it has been always the dream of man to fly and the sport is gaining prominence these days.
So I decided to work on one of the wingsuit to obtain better results in comparison with the already existing models. Since the number of literature works on wingsuit was hard to find, I decided to utilize available resource to a maximum.
 A Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis is carried out to find the various performance parameters of the wingsuit and thereby proving that the magnitude obtained by simulation catches up with the literature values regarding this wingsuit at the given flight conditions.
